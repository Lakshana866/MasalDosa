½ cup urad dal + 1 tablespoon chana dal + 20 methi seeds (fenugreek seeds) in a second bowl
⅓ cup thick poha (flattened rice) in a third bowl.

8. Grind the urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.

9. Remove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula. Here is a pic showing the consistency of the batter.

10. Strain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. I ground in one batch and added 1 cup water for grinding. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.

11. Grind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava like consistency in the batter.

Making potato masala for masala dosa
1. First rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker. You can also boil potatoes in a pan. The potatoes have to be completely cooked.
